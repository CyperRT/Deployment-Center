<h5>Morning, Kieran!<br><br>It's your special day, the one that reminds you how old you are. I ran out of stationary to send you an actual letter nor do I believe in cards. If you so please, you can print and frame this magnum opus of a letter. I can also arrange for this letter to be printed on big matte poster paper. You've probably received better gifts today, so I'm trying to hype this up a bit more. Anyways, how old are you again?<br><br>I'm kidding but only half. To me, you're not very much older. I definetely have seen you being young and dumb yet still weathering through challenges of your own. For you, it's really easy for me to be nostalgic. The first time you invited me over to your place I can't remember why, but it stuck with me. Actually, I remember; you had mods on Minecraft. That was some hot shit, some technical wizardry, something I couldn't for the life of me find out how to install.<br><br>We've spent a lot of time together in a lot of different places. From house to house and through years of yearbook, I don't hesitate to call you my best friend. You're one of the toughest folks I know. I really do wonder how often you look back since you're changing constantly it feels like, for the better of course. There are so many stupid experiences and bits that you and I could recount; I won't do that here, but you probably are already thinking of some in your head. To me, I still see you in the same way, no matter what happens in the future.<br><br>You're really important to me, and I don't say that enough. This year has been awful in the stress and depression of the pandemic. I don't wish or hope happiness for you, those can feel like empty words at times. You yourself are the only one able to confront and deal with your conflicts. And to not repeat empty reassurance, I want to tell you that I can at least lighten some of your burdens. I'm not one for gestures, so I'm telling you: I will be with you whenever you're in need.<br><br>Thank you for your continued friendship and for further ventures.<br><br>Love, Richard<br><br><br><br>'Klee, what's wrong?'<br><br> — I—I'm worried... What if Dodo-King really is in here? And what if he doesn't allow me to become Dodoco's family, or if I lose to him... Then Dodoco can't be with me, and Mom will be very sad too... Dodoco is my bestest friend that Mom ever gave me. I—I'm too scared to press it...<br>Honorary Knight, can you press the button for me?<br><br>"Klee, I can't help you press it."<br><br>— Why?<br><br>"Because I have to hold my weapon."</h5>
